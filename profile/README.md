# Enigma Ecosystem

Enigma is a next-generation privacy infrastructure designed for a world where
**visibility is vulnerability**.

Instead of securing static endpoints, Enigma removes them — replacing fixed
locations with an autonomous fabric of encrypted motion.

## What we’re building

Enigma is composed of modular systems that work together to eliminate
traceability across communication, storage, and computation:

- **RAVID** — Autonomous orchestration and network entropy
- **EPN** — Ephemeral, non-routable privacy networking
- **Vault** — Zero-knowledge, sharded storage
- **Echo** — Encrypted relay for voice, text, and data

Each connection exists briefly, then disappears.

## Guiding principle

**Motion replaces location.**

Privacy is not added as a layer — it becomes the fabric itself.
